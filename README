To make this repo I moved all of the relevant dotfiles to the repo and then created sym links back to their original locations in $HOME

one note is that YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU USE ABSOLUTE PATHS WHEN MAKING THE SYM LINKS

if not, your configs wont work properly

i.e: ln -nfs /Users/user/dotfiles/.config /Users/user/.config
